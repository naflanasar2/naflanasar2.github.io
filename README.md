A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped
with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to
make "almost anything". This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.While fab labs have
yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already
shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal
needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production
